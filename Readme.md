We have decided to develop a courier delivery management system similar to Bluedart, in light of the increased reliance on courier services due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our solution includes improved functionalities, such as parcel tracking and obtaining information about the employee responsible for picking up or delivering your parcel from the branch.

The repository contains the following items:

- Final schema: Provides instructions on how to build the database.
- Data fill: Explains how to populate the database with sample data.
- Project report: Presents a detailed report on the project.
- Sample queries: Includes example queries that can be used with the database.
